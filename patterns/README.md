## Descriptions

- Design Patterns are typically split into three categories
- This is called Gamma Categories after Erich Gamma, one of GoF authors

## Creational Patterns

- Deal with the creation (construction) of objects
- Explicit (constructor) vs Implicit (Dependency Injection, Reflection etc.)
- Wholesale (single statement) vs Piecewise (Step-by-Step)

## Structural Patterns

- Concerned with the structure (e.g. class members)
- Many patterns are wrappers that mimic the underlying class's interface
- Stress the importance of good API design

## Behavioral Patterns

- They are all different, no central theme
